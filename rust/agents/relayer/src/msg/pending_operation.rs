///
/// There are three stages to the lifecycle of a pending operation:
///
/// 1) Prepare: This is called before every submission and will usually have a
/// very short gap between it and the submit call. It can be used to confirm it
/// is ready to be submitted and it can also prepare any data that will be
/// needed for the submission. This way, the preparation can be done while
/// another transaction is being submitted.
///
/// 2) Submit: This is called to submit the operation to the destination
/// blockchain and report if it was successful or not. This is usually the act
/// of submitting a transaction. Ideally this step only sends the transaction
/// and waits for it to be included.
///
/// 3) Confirm: This is called after the operation has been submitted and is
/// responsible for checking if the operation has reached a point at which we
/// consider it safe from reorgs.
